Hello! I decided to create weather app using React.js. It's simple app, where user can choose town in any country he want and check temperature and many other informations about weather in this town! The data is being fetched by API, so data is being updated depedently of hour. I hope you like this project!
API's I was using:
GeoDB - to get every town
OpenWeatherMap - to get weather

How it looks?
